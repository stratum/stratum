# Stratum on a Broadcom based switch

The following guide details how to compile the Stratum binary to run on a Broadcom based switch (i.e. Tomahawk) using Broadcom SDKs.

## ONLPv2 operating system on the switch
Stratum requires an ONLPv2 operating system on the switch. ONF maintains a [fork](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/OpenNetworkLinux) with additional platforms. Follow the [ONL](https://opennetlinux.org/doc-building.html) instructions to setup your device. Here is what your switch should look like:

```bash
# uname -a
Linux as7712 4.14.49-OpenNetworkLinux #4 SMP Tue May 14 20:43:21 UTC 2019 x86_64 GNU/Linux
```

```bash
# cat /etc/os-release
PRETTY_NAME="Debian GNU/Linux 9 (stretch)"
NAME="Debian GNU/Linux"
VERSION_ID="9"
VERSION="9 (stretch)"
VERSION_CODENAME=stretch
ID=debian
HOME_URL="https://www.debian.org/"
SUPPORT_URL="https://www.debian.org/support"
BUG_REPORT_URL="https://bugs.debian.org/"
```

```bash
# cat /etc/onl/SWI
images:ONL-onf-ONLPv2_ONL-OS_<some-date>_AMD64.swi
```
Note the **ONLPv2**!

```bash
# cat /etc/onl/platform
x86-64-<vendor-name>-<box-name>-32x-r0
```

## Pre-built Docker image

Stratum for Broadcom switches can be run inside Docker on the switch itself.
Follow their instructions on how to setup [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).
As part of CI, we publish Stratum with a pre-compiled binary and a set of default configuration files as a [Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/stratumproject/stratum-bcm).
There are two versions, one for SDKLT (`:sdklt`) and one for OpenNSA (`:openNSA`).

```bash
docker pull stratumproject/stratum-bcm:sdklt  # or :opennsa, to update the image
cd stratum/hal/bin/bcm/standalone/docker
DOCKER_IMAGE_TAG=sdklt ./start-stratum-container.sh  # or =opennsa
```

## Compile from source

Sometimes you have to build Stratum from source, e.g. because you develop some private feature or want to try a fix not yet pushed to GitHub.

### Build dependencies

Stratum comes with a [development Docker container](https://github.com/stratum/stratum#development-environment) for build purposes. This is the preferred and supported way of building Stratum, as it has all dependencies installed.

If you for some reason want to build natively, here are some pointers to an environment that worked for us:

- clang-6.0 or newer

- Linux 4.4.0-161-generic

- Ubuntu 16.04.6 LTS

### Building the `stratum_bcm` Debian package

You can build the same package that we publish manually with the following steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/stratum/stratum.git
cd stratum
./setup_dev_env.sh  # You're now inside the docker container
bazel build //stratum/hal/bin/bcm/standalone:stratum_bcm_sdklt_deb  # or stratum_bcm_opennsa_deb
scp ./bazel-bin/stratum/hal/bin/bcm/standalone/stratum_bcm_sdklt_deb.deb root@<your_switch_ip>:
# On the switch
apt-get install -f ./stratum_bcm_sdklt_deb.deb
```

If you're not building inside the docker container, skip the `./setup_dev_env.sh` step.

## Starting Stratum

To start Stratum, use the convenience script we install with the package:

```bash
start-stratum.sh
```

You should see the ports coming up and have a SDKLT shell prompt:
```
I0628 18:29:10.806623  7930 bcm_chassis_manager.cc:1738] State of SingletonPort (node_id: 1, port_id: 34, slot: 1, port: 3, unit: 0, logical_port: 34, speed: 40G): UP
BCMLT.0>
```

Stratum can be customized with several configuration files, passed as CLI flags.
We provide sensible defaults for most platforms and the script automatically
uses the correct ones for the platform.

- base_bcm_chassis_map_file: Protobuf defining chip capabilities and all possible port configurations of a chassis.
    Example found under: `/stratum/hal/config/**platform name**/base_bcm_chassis_map.pb.txt`
- chassis_config_file: Protobuf setting the config of a specific node.
    Selects a subset of the available port configurations from the chassis map. Determines
    which ports will be available.
    Example found under: `/stratum/hal/config/**platform name**/chassis_config.pb.txt`
- bcm_sdk_config_file: Autogenerated SDK configuration file.
- bcm_hardware_specs_file: ACL and UDF properties of chips. Found under: `/stratum/hal/config/bcm_hardware_specs.pb.txt`
- bcm_serdes_db_proto_file: Contains SerDes configuration. Not implemented yet, can be an empty file.

If you followed the build instructions, these should be on the switch under `/etc/stratum/stratum_configs`.
Depending on your actual cabling, setup or hardware, you'll have to adjust the config files.

### Manual SDK setup on the switch

**ONLY needed when not using Docker or the start script!**

The `start-stratum.sh` script takes care of setting up the SDKs for you. Should
something go wrong, these steps help you troubleshoot:

#### SDKLT

SDKLT requires two Kernel modules to be installed for Packet IO and interfacing with the ASIC. We provide prebuilt binaries for Kernel 4.14.49 in the Debian package and the SDKLT [tarball](https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/SDKLT/releases). Install them before running stratum:

```bash
cd /usr/lib/stratum/
# or
wget https://github.com/opennetworkinglab/SDKLT/releases/...
tar xf sdklt-4.14.49.tgz
insmod linux_ngbde.ko && insmod linux_ngknet.ko
```

Check for correct install:

```bash
# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
linux_ngknet          352256  0
linux_ngbde            32768  1 linux_ngknet
# dmesg -H
[Jan10 10:53] linux-kernel-bde (6960): MSI not used
[  +2.611898] Broadcom NGBDE loaded successfully
```

#### OpenNSA

From the Stratum package, install the Kernel modules:

```bash
insmod linux-kernel-bde.ko && insmod linux-user-bde.ko && insmod linux-bcm-knet.ko
```

Check for correct install:

```bash
# lsmod
Module                  Size  Used by
linux_bcm_knet         77824  0
linux_user_bde         24576  0
linux_kernel_bde       61440  2 linux_bcm_knet,linux_user_bde
# dmesg -H
[Apr14 21:31] linux-kernel-bde (11885): MSI not used
```

## Troubleshooting

### `insmod: ERROR: could not insert module linux_ngbde.ko: Invalid module format`

You are trying to insert Kernel modules build for a different Kernel version. Make sure your switch looks exactly like described under Runtime dependencies.


### No traffic on ports with partial ChassisConfig [OpenNSA]

When using a Chassis config that does not contain all possible ports of the
switch, traffic might not be received or sent on a subset or all of the ports.
This is because of a quirk in the OpenNSA SDK and its config file, which we
generate from the chassis config. It seems that only initializing some ports
of a port quad (i.e. 3 and 4, but not 1 and 2, using logical port numbers)
leads to this behaviour. Easiest fix is to use the full file and set unwanted
ports administratively to down state.

### OpenNSA config file error

Your base chassis map contains values that OpenNSA does not understand. You can
check which config was generated in `--bcm_sdk_config_file`.
