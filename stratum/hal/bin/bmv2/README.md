# Running Stratum with the P4.org bmv2 software switch

## Dependencies

> You can skip installing system dependencies, bmv2, and PI if you are
> using the Docker environment (setup_dev_env.sh)

### Install system dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install libjudy-dev libgmp-dev libpcap-dev libboost1.58-all-dev
```

### Create a local directory where you will install bmv2
```
mkdir bmv2_install
export BMV2_INSTALL=`pwd`/bmv2_install
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$BMV2_INSTALL/lib
```
*If you plan on adding interfaces to bmv2 (which can be done by providing the
appropriate Chassis Config file when starting bmv2), you will need to run the
binary as root and therefore you may want to install bmv2 in a standard system
directory instead. For example you can set `BMV2_INSTALL` to /usr/local. In this
case you do not need to modify `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` but you will need to run `sudo
ldconfig` after the installation.*

### Install PI
```
git clone https://github.com/p4lang/PI.git
cd PI
./autogen.sh
./configure --without-bmv2 --without-proto --without-fe-cpp --without-cli --without-internal-rpc --prefix=$BMV2_INSTALL
make [-j4]
[sudo] make install
[sudo ldconfig]
```
The *master* branch should work for this repo. Otherwise, you can use the
commit we use for testing, which is specified in the `Dockerfile.build` file in
the root of this repo (look for `ARG PI_COMMIT=...` at the top of the file).

### Install bmv2
```
git clone https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model.git bmv2
cd bmv2
./autogen.sh
./configure CPPFLAGS="-isystem$BMV2_INSTALL/include" --without-nanomsg --without-thrift --with-pi --prefix=$BMV2_INSTALL
make [-j4]
[sudo] make install
[sudo ldconfig]
```
The *master* branch should work for this repo. Otherwise, you can use the
commit we use for testing, which is specified in the `Dockerfile.build` file in
the root of this repo (look for `ARG BMV2_COMMIT=...` at the top of the file).

## Building the `stratum_bmv2` binary

The `stratum_bmv2` binary is a standalone executable which includes:
1. a Stratum implementation for bmv2
2. the `v1model` datapath

To build `stratum_bmv2`, make sure that the `BMV2_INSTALL` environment variable
is set and points to your local bmv2 installation. Then build the Bazel target:
```
bazel build //stratum/hal/bin/bmv2:stratum_bmv2
```

## Running the `stratum_bmv2` binary

As of now the `stratum_bmv2` binary *can only be run from the root of your
Stratum Bazel workspace*:

```
./bazel-bin/stratum/hal/bin/bmv2/stratum_bmv2 \
    --persistent_config_dir=<config dir> \
    --forwarding_pipeline_configs_file=<config dir>/p4_pipeline.pb.txt \
    --chassis_config_file=<config dir>/chassis_config.pb.txt \
    --bmv2_log_level=debug
```

You can ignore the following error, we are working on fixing it:
```
E0808 17:57:36.513559 29298 utils.cc:120] StratumErrorSpace::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND:  not found.
E0808 17:57:36.513905 29298 utils.cc:76] Return Error: ReadFileToString(filename, &text) failed with StratumErrorSpace::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND:  not found.
W0808 17:57:36.513913 29298 config_monitoring_service.cc:106] No saved chassis config found in . This is normal when the switch is just installed.
```

For a sample `chassis_config.pb.txt` file, see sample_config.proto.txt in this
directory. For each singleton port, use the Linux interface name as the `name`
and set the `admin_state` to `ADMIN_STATE_ENABLED`.

Assigning interfaces to bmv2 requires the `stratum_bmv2` binary to have the
`CAP_NET_RAW` capability. Based on your Linux distribution and the location of
the binary, you may be able to add the capability to the binary with `setcap`
and run it as an unprivileged user. You can also simply run the `stratum_bmv2`
as root.

As a basic test, you can run the following commands. It will start a P4Runtime
client in a Docker image and perform a `SetForwardingPipelineConfig` RPC (which
pushes a new P4 data plane to bmv2). You will need a bmv2 JSON file and a P4Info
Protobuf text file, which you can obtain by compiling your P4 program with the
[p4c](https://github.com/p4lang/p4c) compiler.
```
# compile P4 program (skip if you already have the bmv2 JSON file and the P4Info
# text file)
p4c -b bmv2 -a v1model -o /tmp/ --p4runtime-format text --p4runtime-file /tmp/<prog>.proto.txt <prog>.p4
# run P4Runtime client
cp stratum/hal/bin/bmv2/update_config.py /tmp/ && \
[sudo] docker run -v /tmp:/tmp -w /tmp p4lang/pi ./update_config.py \
    --grpc-addr <YOUR_HOST_IP_ADDRESS>:28000 --json <prog>.json --p4info <prog>.proto.txt
```

You can use the loopback program under `stratum/pipelines/loopback/p4c-out/bmv2` if you do not have your own
P4 program.
