# Stratum on Barefoot Tofino based switches

Stratum is supported on Barefoot Tofino based switches. There are
several documents to help get you understand how to build, run, and test
these targets.

There are two different Stratum targets for Tofino:

`stratum_bf` is based on the [PI](https://github.com/p4lang/PI) C++ API is the
better tested and supported target. This target is still recommended for most
users.

`stratum_bfrt` is a newer target based on Barefoot's BfRt C++ API. This target
is still experimental, but gives users access to additional Tofino features.
The plan is to make this target the default when it has matured.

The easiest way to get started is with the pre-built Docker images. See
the "Running" guide below for more details.
