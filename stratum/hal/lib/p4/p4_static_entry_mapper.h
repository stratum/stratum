// P4StaticEntryMapper is a P4TableMapper helper class.  Similar to
// P4TableMapper, one instance exists per configured P4 device ID.
// P4StaticEntryMapper manages the static table entries, i.e. those defined
// as "const entries" in the P4 program, for the device it represents.  The
// P4StaticEntryMapper recognizes two types of static entries.  The first
// type consists of entries that get programmed directly into the switch's
// physical tables, such as the cluster MAC entry for L2 lookups.  The second
// type consists of entries in "hidden" tables.  These entries are never
// directly programmed into physical tables.  Instead, they typically get
// combined into actions for other physical tables.  Encap/decap operations
// in Stratum P4 programs are an example of this type.  Both types of static
// entries can be affected by changes to the P4PipelineConfig.
//
// P4StaticEntryMapper is platform independent.  It provides common information
// to help the target switch implementation program static flows, but the
// details of programming these flows remain a target-specific responsibility.

// P4TableMapper.  This could be reworked to pass in a set of
// hidden table IDs instead.  Tunneling may add other dependencies, which
// could be addressed by having P4TableMapper inherit from a small
// interface class to inject into P4StaticEntryMapper.

// in the P4PipelineConfig push process to identify any changes that delete,
// change, or modify static table entries.

  // to other parts of the P4PipelineConfig.
  // TODO(unknown): It may be beneficial for P4ConfigVerifier to be able to
  // call a Verify method in this class for assistance.

  // These two methods support P4PipelineConfig pushes.  The role of these
  // methods relative to the overall pipeline config push is described by
  // the P4TableMapper interface for static table entries.
  // P4TableMapper's HandlePrePushStaticEntryChanges and
  // HandlePostPushStaticEntryChanges methods are wrappers to these functions.
  //
  // Both HandlePrePushChanges and HandlePostPushChanges modify the
  // internal state of P4StaticEntryMapper with the expectation that the caller
  // will proceed to act on the output.  Thus, two successive calls to
  // HandlePrePushChanges with the same parameter values will yield different
  // output.  The second call yields an empty out_request because the
  // internal state accounts for the deleted entries from the first call.  Both
  // methods return an OK status to indicate success, and the output messages
  // contain the entries for the caller to change, if any.  Either method can
  // return ERR_REBOOT_REQUIRED if they detect some reason a change cannot be
  // accomplished.  Neither method produces any output for entries in hidden,
  // non-physical tables, but a change in the entries for such tables results
  // in an ERR_REBOOT_REQUIRED status.
