# Stratum Release Plan

Stratum follows the "live at head" philosophy where all development happens at
HEAD. This means there are no long term support (LTS) branches, no feature
backports and we do not practice semantic versioning (SemVer). In return, this
lightweight approach allows us to be fast moving and adaptive.

Users are expected to regularly update to the latest version, but for
deployments we offer quarterly releases. These are tagged off the main branch at
the time of creation and left untouched after that. A release contains a list of
changes, new platforms and pre-built artifacts. We name them based on the
release date in the form `year.month`, e.g., `21.03` for the March 2021 release.
All releases can be found on the GitHub
[release](https://github.com/stratum/stratum/releases) page.

Releases are tagged in the repository using a fully qualified date string:
`YYYY-MM-DD`. You can check them out in `git` using the tag name.

We may periodically tag the tree in between releases to support community
deployments. For example, this could occur after a bug fix or new feature is
merged, but before the official release. When this occurs, we will use the date
format (`YYYY-MM-DD`) as the tag, but there will not be an entry added to the
release page with release notes.

## Breaking Changes

> How are breaking changes handled without SemVer?

For breaking changes we do non-atomic refactoring with continuous deployments,
as seen in other projects like Abseil, Bazel or Protobuf:

0. Release N: Contains old feature
1. New feature added at head
    - Discuss at TST meetings and on pull requests
    - Ensure no changes to the old feature (sometimes this means introducing a
      new target)
    - Include tools and docs for assisted migration
    - Mark old functionality as deprecated
2. Release N+1: New feature is included
    - Old and new feature is available; old one is deprecated (expect logs)
3. Release N+2: Old feature is removed
    - Clients must use the new feature
