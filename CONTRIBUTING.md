# How to Contribute

We'd love to accept your patches and contributions to this project. There are
just a few small guidelines you need to follow.

## Contributor License Agreement

Contributions to this project must be accompanied by a Contributor License
Agreement. You (or your employer) retain the copyright to your contribution,
this simply gives us permission to use and redistribute your contributions as
part of the project. Head over to <https://cla.developers.google.com/> to see
your current agreements on file or to sign a new one.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one
(even if it was for a different project), you probably don't need to do it
again.

## Submitting Code

### General Information

Stratum follows [Google's Engineering Practices](https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/developer/). Use this document as a guide when submitting code.

Some additional points:
 
 - Submit your changes early and often. GitHub has (Draft PRs)[https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/] that allow you to share your code with others during development. Input and corrections early in the process prevent huge changes later.
 
 - Stratum uses a [squash and rebase](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-request-merges#squash-and-merge-your-pull-request-commits) model. You do **not** have to do this by hand! GitHub will guide you through it, if possible.
 
 - Consider opening a separate issue describing the technical details there and [link it to the PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/closing-issues-using-keywords). This keeps code review and design discussions clean.

### Steps to Follow

1. Fork Stratum into your personal or organization account via the fork button on GitHub.

2. Make your code changes.

3. Pass all unit tests locally. Create new tests for new code and **add the targets to the [build-targets.txt](.circleci/build-targets.txt) and [test-targets.txt](.circleci/test-targets.txt) files** in the same PR, so CI can pick them up! Execute the following command in the Stratum root directory to run all currently enabled tests: `xargs -a .circleci/test-targets.txt bazel test`

4. Check code style compliance with `cpplint` and `clang-format` (pre-installed in development docker container).

5. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/stratum/stratum/compare). Consider [allowing maintainers](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) to make changes if you want direct assistance from maintainers.

6. Wait for [CI checks](https://circleci.com/gh/stratum/stratum) to pass. You can check the [coverage report](https://codecov.io/gh/stratum/stratum) after they ran. Repeat steps 3. and 4. as necessary. **Passing CI is mandatory.** If the CI check does not run automatically, make sure you [unfollow your fork](https://support.circleci.com/hc/en-us/articles/360008097173) on CircleCI.

7. Await review. Everyone can comment on code changes, but only Collaborators and above can give final review approval. **All changes must get at least one approval**. Join one of the [communication channels](https://wiki.opennetworking.org/display/COM/Stratum+Wiki+Home+Page) to request a review or to bring additional attention to your PR.
